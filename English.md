This code is an OpenAI Chatbot written in the Python programming language. The Chatbot uses OpenAI's ChatGPT model to answer questions that the user takes a screenshot of.

The program also uses the PyAutoGUI library to take screenshots, the Tesseract library for optical character recognition (OCR), and the gTTS library for speech synthesis.

Additionally, the program uses the Pynput library for the user to select the corner points of the area where they want to take a screenshot by pressing the 1 and 2 keys on their keyboard.

The program uses speech synthesis to audibly speak the answer to the question it receives. Additionally, it uses Python's SpeechRecognition library to respond to voice commands.

This code requires an API key to access the OpenAI API, and the correct location of Tesseract must be specified. It has only been tested on Windows operating systems and may require editing for different paths to Tesseract on Linux operating systems.
